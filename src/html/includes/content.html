      <h1><span class="b">COOKIE POLICY</span></h1>
      This Cookie Policy explains how ComplaintsBoard.com
      (<strong>"Company"</strong>, <strong>"we"</strong>, <strong>"us"</strong>,
      and <strong>"our"</strong>) uses cookies and similar technologies to
      recognize you when you visit our website at
      https://www.complaintsboard.com (<strong>"Website"</strong>). It explains
      what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to
      control our use of them.<br /><br />
      <h2>What are cookies?</h2>
      <br />
      Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile
      device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners
      in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well
      as to provide reporting information.
      <br /><br />Cookies set by the website owner (in this case,
      ComplaintsBoard.com) are called "first party cookies". Cookies set by
      parties other than the website owner are called "third party cookies".
      Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be
      provided on or through the website (e.g. like advertising, interactive
      content and analytics). The parties that set these third party cookies can
      recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question and
      also when it visits certain other websites. <br /><br />
      <h2>Why do we use cookies?</h2>
      <br />
      We use first and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are
      required for technical reasons in order for our Website to operate, and we
      refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other
      cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to
      enhance the experience on our Online Properties. Third parties serve
      cookies through our Website for advertising, analytics and other purposes.
      This is described in more detail below.
      <br />
      The specific types of first and third party cookies served through our
      Website and the purposes they perform are described below (please note
      that the specific cookies served may vary depending on the specific Online
      Properties you visit):
      <br /><br />
      <u><strong>Essential website cookies</strong></u

      <br />
      These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services
      available through our Website and to use some of its features, such as
      access to secure areas.

      Google uses cookies to help serve the ads it displays on the websites of
      its partners, such as websites displaying Google ads or participating in
      Google certified ad networks. When users visit a Google partner's website,
      a cookie may be dropped on that end user's browser. The Google AdSense
      service we use to serve advertising uses a DoubleClick cookie to serve
      more relevant ads across the web and limit the number of times that a
      given ad is shown to you.
      <br />
      Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a
      user's prior visits to your website or other websites.
      <br />
      Google's use of advertising cookies enables it and its partners to serve
      ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and/or other sites on
      the Internet.
      <br />
      Users may opt out of personalized advertising by visiting
      <a href="https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated">Ads Settings</a>.
      (Alternatively, you can opt out of a third-party vendor's use of cookies
      for personalized advertising by visiting
      <a href="https://aboutads.info">www.aboutads.info.</a>)
      <br />
      The cookies of other third-party vendors or ad networks may also be used
      to serve ads on our Website.
      <br />
      To control interest-based advertising from certain third-party advertising
      partners, you can learn more about opting out of receiving interest-based
      ads at <a href="https://optout.aboutads.info">optout.aboutads.info</a> and

      <br /><br />
      <h2>What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?</h2>
      <br />
      Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website.
      We may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons
      (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs"). These are tiny
      graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to
      recognize when someone has visited our Websites or opened an e-mail that
      we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic
      patterns of users from one page within our Website to another, to deliver
      or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our
      Website from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website,
      to improve site performance, and to measure the success of e-mail
      marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on
      cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their
      functioning.
      <br /><br />
      <h2>Do you use Flash cookies or Local Shared Objects?</h2>
      <br />
      Our Website may also use so-called "Flash Cookies" (also known as Local
      Shared Objects or "LSOs") to, among other things, collect and store
      information about your use of our services, fraud prevention and for other
      site operations.
      <br />
      If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you can adjust
      the settings of your Flash player to block Flash Cookies storage using the
      tools contained in the
      <a
        href="https://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html#_blank"
        >Website Storage Settings Panel</a
      >. You can also control Flash Cookies by going to the
      <a
        href="https://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html#_blank"
        >Global Storage Settings Panel</a
      >
      and following the instructions (which may include instructions that
      explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash Cookies (referred to
      "information" on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from
      being placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash
      Player 8 and later) how to block Flash Cookies that are not being
      delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time).
      <br /><br />
      Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance
      of Flash Cookies may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash
      applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in
      connection with our services or online content.
      <br /><br />
      <h2>Do you serve targeted advertising?</h2>
      <br />
      Third parties may serve cookies on your computer or mobile device to serve
      advertising through our Websites. These companies may use information
      about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide relevant
      advertisements about goods and services that you may be interested in.
      They may also employ technology that is used to measure the effectiveness
      of advertisements. This can be accomplished by them using cookies or web
      beacons to collect information about your visits to this and other sites
      in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services of
      potential interest to you. The information collected through this process
      does not enable us or them to identify your name, contact details or other
      details that directly identify you unless you choose to provide these.
      <br /><br />
      <h2>How do I control cookies?</h2>
      <br />
      You can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse
      cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our website
      though your access to some functionality and areas of our website may be
      restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web
      browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your
      browser's help menu for more information.
      <br />
      In addition, most advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of
      targeted advertising. If you would like to find out more information,
